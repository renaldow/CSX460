## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)

apropos("prop")

library(randomForest)

sessionInfo()

pages <- 97

town <- "richmand"


month.abb


weights <- c(90, 150, 111, 123)

weights

mean(weights)

colors <- c("red", "blue", "red", "white", "green")

colors2 <- as.factor(colors)

colors2

both <- list(colors = colors2, weight = weights)

 both[[1]]
 
 mat <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3)
 
 mat[1, 2:3]
 
 
 x <- c(9, 15, 11, 23)
 xhat <- c(7, 13, 9, 21)
 
 delta <- (x - xhat)^2 %>% 
   
    x <- c(3, 4, 11, 23)
 xhat <- c(5, 13, 29, 51)
 
  delta <- (x - xhat)
  
  delta <- (x - xhat) %>% abs() 
  
  delta <- (x - xhat) %>% abs() %>% sum()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
